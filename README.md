### Usage

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt window on your system.

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**

3. **Open Terminal in the Directory:**
   Once you're in the directory containing the Java files and class files, right-click anywhere in the file explorer window.

4. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt Here:**
   From the context menu that appears after right-clicking, select "Open in Terminal" or "Open Command Prompt Here" option. This will open a terminal or command prompt window already navigated to the correct directory.
